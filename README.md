# Welcome to the Facebook Friend Suggestions project!

This project uses machine learning to provide relevant friend recommendations to Facebook users. The goal is to help users expand their social networks by suggesting new friends they may be interested in connecting with.

To achieve this, the project utilizes graph datasets of Facebook users and their relationships to train the machine learning algorithms. The project involves feature engineering to create new features and convert the problem into a binary classification format. Several machine learning models were trained including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

The results of the project were impressive with an F1 score of 90%. This score demonstrates the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms used in generating accurate and relevant friend suggestions for Facebook users.
